					<H3 id="overview" style="margin: 1em 0em 0em 0em;">Overview:</H3>
					<div class="pagebag">
						<p class="spread">
My objective in developing this collection of HTML pages was achieve two goals.
One goal was to present content about the technology offered for potential customers in a complete and organized view that respects the customer's limited time.
The second goal is to share part of my personal interests in the hope that I might be able to offer information useful to others.
Building this site required a good understanding of the interplay of the three basic web specifications (
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp">HTML5</a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/">JavaScript</a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_intro.asp">CSS3</a>) and how these
specifications are implemented in the various web browser applications.						</p>

						<p class="spread">
							I am aware of the many popular libraries available to developers
							hosted at <a target="_blank"
								href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/">Google
								Hosted Libraries</a>. jQuery is extremely popular with developers<sup><a
								class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. These libraries are great
							resources for professional developers. They contain script and
							style content that has been tested to work correctly in most all
							browsers by resolving the inconsistencies among them. In addition
							they hide much of the underlying details required to achieve
							certain functionalities. That improves the productivity of web
							developers. Nevertheless, to best understand the interaction of
							the web specifications it was important to not use any of these
							libraries in the development of this OLD TUG
							web content.
						</p>

						<p class="spread">
							To build a complete web resource for OLD TUG
							it was necessary to provide both a non-mobile style presentation
							and a mobile style presentation. The first step to develop the
							site was to obtain a tool chain. The tool chain is described in <a
								href="../mobile/mobile-ToolHomePage.html">Web Tool
								Chain</a>. The design effort was started by first developing the
							non-mobile presentation. The presentation model design pattern
							that is used on the non-mobile page is the horizontal
							Master/Detail<sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>.
							The horizontal version of this model provides a selectable
							content map of the site in the left side view and the content for
							the selected subject in the window of the right side view. The
							model sets the content map as the Master and the content view for
							the selected subject as the Detail.
						</p>

						<p class="spread">The style chosen for the Master/Detail model
							uses a fixed width Master view and a resizable Detail view. The
							combined width of the Master and Detail views is set to a fixed
							maximum. The two views are centered in the browser's frame and
							the unused background area displays the image of a bay. A header
							and a footer are placed at the top and bottom. The header
							contains the logo and name of OLD TUG. The
							header's configuration changes to adapt to the available
							horizontal space in the browser's window. The footer serves only
							as a base that underscores the Master/Detail display.</p>

						<p class="spread">The mobile presentation is based on the
							non-mobile style used. The constraint imposed by the limited
							display area on most mobile browser based devices lead to the
							development of a slider style presentation. The Master/Detail
							view in this solution is rendered as two containers within a
							single container. The Master view of the non-mobile style is the
							left side of the slider and the Detail view is the right side.
							The header is retained as a fixed display at the top of the view
							and a narrow Site Directory link is added between the header and
							slider. The Site Directory link was deemed necessary to ensure
							the slider didn't inadvertently hide the site directory
							information.</p>

						<p class="spread">The slider mentioned is a structure that
							hides one or the other half of the display content. In the mobile
							browser there is a swipe feature that allows the user to swipe
							the screen to sequence through a set of parallel panels. This is
							a common mechanism used on websites when there are a number of
							images to view. Using this same mechanism here permits the user
							to swipe right to view the Site Directory and swipe left to view
							the selected content. When a specific content is selected in the
							Site Directory view the associated content is immediately
							displayed with the Site Directory view hidden.</p>
					</div> <!-- pagebag -->

					<H3 id="formatting_view" style="margin: .8em 0em 0em 0em;">Non-Mobile
						Formatting the Master/Detail view:</H3>
					<div class="pagebag">
						<p class="spread">The challenge in creating the desired
							non-mobile view was dynamically arranging all of the containers
							so that they continue to be rendered by browsers in the desired
							order while resizing the browser's frame. The top level container
							for the rendered page is the &lt;body&gt;. The limited width
							content area is a &lt;div&gt; tag container assigned the unique
							ID "scripted". The body contains the four section containers that
							were created using &lt;div&gt; tags. Each &lt;div&gt; tag was
							assigned a unique ID {header, master, detail, footer}.</p>
						<p class="spread">The initial effort to create a dynamic
							format was a bit disappointing. After some research the solution
							found requires the following document features. The Detail
							&lt;div&gt; container is assigned a left margin style that is the
							same width as the Master &lt;div&gt;. This creates the space in
							which the Master container will reside. The Master &lt;div&gt;
							width is set to the fixed width of the Detail's left margin. The
							Master style is set to float left. The default float setting for
							all document elements is 'none'. Setting the float property to
							left on the Master &lt;div&gt; instructs the browser to take this
							element from the normal flow and placed it along the left side of
							its container. Then other elements are floated around it. Any
							resize of the browser's frame width triggers a javascript method
							that computes a new width for the Detail view. This new width is
							the difference between the fixed Master width and the available
							width of the browsers frame. This allows the combined width of
							the two side-by-side containers to fit in the new browser frame
							size. The Master view always remains to the left of the Detail
							because the fixed left margin of the Detail &lt;div&gt; always
							has space for the fixed width Master. The computed width of the
							Detail view has a fixed minimum value.</p>
					</div> <!-- pagebag -->

					<H3 id="inserting_docs" style="margin: .8em 0em 0em 0em;">Non-Mobile
						Inserting documents:</H3>
					<div class="pagebag">
						<p class="spread">
							The &lt;iframe&gt; tag was used as the detail view's container
							because the document displayed inside the detail view varies. I
							enjoyed the modularity of inserted content so I also created a
							separate Master view HTML document that was also inserted into an
							&lt;iframe&gt; tag. In some browsers that approach worked fine
							but it did not work in Google's Chrome. Google implemented a
							security feature in Chrome such that no inserted document content
							can modify any other inserted document. As a consequence the
							event methods initiated on the inserted Master view document
							could not change the source document for the &lt;iframe&gt; tag
							of the Detail view. I believe this restriction is a result of the
							same-origin policy in Chrome<sup><a class="footnote"
								href="#fn3">3</a></sup>. There are apparently ways to circumvent that
							policy. The document created for the Master was inserted into the
							&lt;body&gt; container in order to keep the design as simple as
							possible and to assure compatibility for the users of this site.
						</p>
					</div> <!-- pagebag -->

					<H3 id="unscripted_view" style="margin: .8em 0em 0em 0em;">Non-Mobile
						Providing the unscripted view:</H3>
					<div class="pagebag">
						<p class="spread">There is a feature added to the site's
							default web page that can distinguish whether the user's browser
							is configured to turn off the javascript. It is not typical for a
							user to do that but it was an interesting "what if".</p>
						<p class="spread">A "scrpted" container was created using
							&lt;div&gt; tag and assigned the ID "scripted". Beneath this
							container the &lt;noscript&gt; HTML tag was used to create a
							conditional container with content that is executed by the
							browser only in the case that the javascript is turned off. The
							"scripted" container is assigned a class name "hidden". Followng
							the &lt;noscript&gt; container is a an embedded &lt;script&gt;
							field that contains a javascript function call to the
							'scriptcheck();' method.</p>
						<p class="spread">It is important to this functionality that
							the browser processes the document's content sequentially and
							does not display the final page until it has been entirely
							processed. The "scripted" container will not be displayed by the
							browser because the CSS style for the class selector "hidden"
							sets the display style to "none". The 'scriptcheck();' method is
							only executed provided that the user's browser has the javascript
							enabled. The javascript method scriptcheck() automatically
							changes the "scripted" &lt;div&gt; tag's class name in the
							document content from "hidden" to "shown". The CSS style for the
							class selector "shown" sets the display style to "default".</p>
					</div> <!-- pagebag -->

					<H3 id="modal_dialog" style="margin: .8em 0em 0em 0em;">Non-Mobile
						The modal dialog on loading:</H3>
					<div class="pagebag">
						<p class="spread">A modal dialog is displayed to notify the
							user about a significant circumstance or event the very first
							time that the site default web document is loaded. The design
							intent for this modal dialog is to display it only once when the
							default document is first loaded during the browser session.</p>
						<p class="spread">The modal content resides within the
							&lt;div&gt; element of the scripted introduction document. That
							document is the one that is initially displayed in the Detail
							section of the main page. The modal &lt;div&gt; is positioned
							immediately after the &lt;body&gt; HTML tag. The modal
							&lt;div&gt; tag is assigned the id name "myModal" and class name
							"modal".</p>
						<p class="spread">The style for the "modal" class has the
							display property assigned to 'block' (the default). The 'block'
							display property value instructs the browser to initially display
							the content. The "modal" class style has the z-index property set
							to 1. This instructs the browser to display the element on top of
							the body element rather than as part of it. The modal class style
							also has the position property assigned 'fixed' so that the
							element is rendered by the browser using a fixed screen
							coordinate rather than an in-line element. The "modal" style sets
							the fixed location of its element to the zero position for both
							the top and left. This places the 'myModal' element at the top
							left corner of its containing 'Detail' element. The "modal" style
							assigns 100% to the width and height property so that the "modal"
							element has the full width and height of the Detail view. The
							"modal" style sets the color and opacity of its background using
							the RGBA "background-color" property. The "A" in RGBA is alpha
							channel. It can be set to values from 0 to 1. At 1 the background
							is fully opaque. The color is set to black and the opacity is set
							to 0.4. By setting a partial opacity with the black color the
							entire Detail view is given a grayed out appearance.</p>
						<p class="spread">Another &lt;div&gt; element is placed in the
							'myModal' element and is assigned the class name "modal-content".
							This element comprises the visible modal dialog box.</p>
						<p class="spread">The style for "modal-content" sets the width
							to 50% of the myModal container. The display width is always one
							half of the myModal container which in turn is the full width of
							the Detail view. The "modal-content" styled &lt;div&gt; container
							is centered in its containing element. Fluff was added such as
							background color and border. The initial content inside this
							element creates the 'X' character used to close the modal
							display. The 'X' is just a text letter in a span tag. The span
							tag is the class name "closeThisModal" and the 'onClick' event.</p>
						<p class="spread">The style for "closeThisModal" assigns the
							display format for the letter X along with the rounded border and
							background color. The style sets the cursor hover and focus
							behavior.</p>
						<p class="spread">The span containing the letter X has the
							onClick event assigned to a javascript function. That function
							changes the modalView class's display style to "none". Setting
							display to none instructs the browser to no longer display the
							modalView &lt;div&gt; element. Because the user can also choose
							to click elsewhere in the introduction document an onClick method
							was also assigned to the introduction document's &lt;body&gt;
							element. This event's script also sets the modalView class's
							display style to "none".
						<p class="spread">The design intent is that this modal view is
							not displayed every time that the browser reloads the default
							document during the same session. Happily HTML5 has included the
							window.sessionStorage feature. The window.sessionStorage is used
							to implement this design intent.</p>
						<p class="spread">A script container is placed at the very
							start of the default web document. This script is executed by the
							browser while loading the document. The javascript contained
							creates the "justOnce" data item in the sessionStore and assigns
							the string "FALSE". A script container is also added as the last
							item in the scripted introduction document. The javascript in
							this container examines the current value of the
							sessionStorage.justOnce data item. If it is "FALSE" the display
							style for the modalView is set to "inline" so that the modal view
							is displayed by the browser. If it is "TRUE" the dislay style is
							set to "none" so that the browser does not display the modalView
							element. In each of the onClick javascript methods described
							earlier the sessionStorage.justOnce data item is set to "TRUE".
							As long as the session persists all subsequent browser displays
							of the scripted introduction document do not display the modal
							dialog.</p>

					<H3 id="detect_mobile" style="margin: .8em 0em 0em 0em;">Non-Mobile
						Detecting a mobile browser:</H3>
					<div class="pagebag">
						<p class="spread">
							There are a great many different mobile devices available to
							people. The use of mobile and tablet devices to access
							information on the internet has surpassed the use of desktop PCs<sup><a
								class="footnote" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>. Mobile browsers format the
							HTML content differently. A standard web document will be
							minimized to fit the mobile device's screen resulting in an
							unreadable presentation. It is important to provide site content
							that is designed to be rendered effectively by a mobile browser.
						</p>
						<p class="spread">On most servers the default web content
							displayed by the browser when it initially connects to the server
							is typically one of several common file names {index.html,
							index.htm, index.php}. Each server is configured for what default
							document file name is presented to a browser when it makes the
							initial HTTP document request. The file's name (for example
							index.htm) is the same default document file name used for all of
							the browsers that connect to the site.</p>
						<p class="spread">The document file initially loaded by the
							browser is typically formatted for the traditional desktop or
							laptop PC browser. In order to present content designed
							specifically for a mobile browser the initial document needs to
							interrogate the type of browser connecting and then switch to the
							mobile content for browsers identified as mobile. All browsers
							processe the entire HTML content of the default document obtained
							from the web site before displaying it. This is important for the
							capability to detect and switch to work.</p>
						<p class="spread">The solution is the addition of a script
							container to the default document file as the very last element.
							The javascript in that script container performs a function call
							that reads the navigator.userAgent and compares it to a list of
							currently known mobile browser identifiers. If the result of the
							comparison has a match then the javascript sets the
							window.location to a new document file that is formatted for a
							mobile browser.</p>
					</div> <!-- pagebag -->

					<H3 id="slider_mechanics" style="margin: .8em 0em 0em 0em;">Mobile
						Slider mechanics:</H3>
					<div class="pagebag">
						<p class="spread">The non-mobile content was designed using a
							Master/Detail display pattern. Mobile device screens are too
							narrow to be able to reuse that pattern. There are a number of
							good patterns used by developers for mobile devices. The intent
							is to try something a bit different. The desire is to present the
							same pattern but allow the user to swipe the screen to view
							either the Master or the Detail view. The slider function is the
							mechanism used to enable this feature. The slider function is
							most commonly used on web sites to display a sequence of images
							that are arranged in parallel and are displayed one after another
							in response to the user swipe events from the touch screen.</p>
						<p class="spread">Getting this function to work came with some
							challenges. Among the chief insights to achieving success was the
							understanding that the containers intended to be arranged
							horizontally must all have the exact same width dimension.
							Another insight was that the horizontally arranged containers
							must all reside within a common container. The common container
							is assigned the class name 'visualContainer'. The visualContainer
							class is the view port into which each of the subsequent
							container pages must fit exactly. It defines the window in which
							an individual view is slid into.</p>
						<p class="spread">Inside the visualContainer object is placed
							a wide &lt;div&gt; container that is assigned the class name
							'contentContainer'. The contentContainer &lt;div&gt; must be
							assigned a width that is the total width of all the objects that
							it contains.</p>
						<p class="spread">Each of the individual slider views are
							assigned the class name 'container' and since there are only two
							container class objects they are assigned a width of 50%. So each
							of the two individual object views, Master and Detail, are
							assigned 50% of the total width assigned to the contentContainer.
							If there were four slider views then the width of the
							contentContainer would need to double and each slider view would
							be assigned a width of 25%. The resulting width of the each
							individual slider view must match the width of the
							visualContainer.</p>
						<p class="spread">To align a desired slider view into the
							visualContainer the contentContainer needs to have its left
							property adjusted to reveal it. The left property sets the left
							edge of the contentContainer to an absolute position. In this
							case when left=0 the Master view is displayed. When left=-100%
							the contentContainer's left edge is placed to the left of the
							visualContainer by 100% of the visualContainer's width. This
							reveals the second slider view in the window of the
							visualContainer object. In this case 100% is sufficient since
							there are only two slicer views. If there were three then -200%
							would reveal the third view.</p>
