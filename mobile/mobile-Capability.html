<!--  
  indexMobile.html is the mobile web page (index page) of a web site that serves the site's mobile device access.
  This and all other web content on this site was hand written by John Hunsberger to demonstrate some simple, 
  perhaps useful techniques and to highlight some issues as well.  This content is open for anyone to copy.  If 
  you have questions or opinions about this content feel free to contact me.  The ideas presented are not my invention, 
  they are my application.
  
  The original design choice mimicked the standard page but added the slider that is still in use.  I found that
  because the right side contained page used an iFrame that it removed the page's swipe response.  Starting that
  slider on the left most page allowed the user to swipe left to expose the right page containing the iFrame but
  once the iFrame was exposed the user could not swipe right to return to the left page.  A modified structure
  as implemented here was devised to eliminate that.
  
  Design Notes:
	1. This page contains a slider.  The Slider.css defines the necessary format to hide a page depending on the 
	   relative position of the visualContainer (either 0 or -100%).  When position 0 page 1 shows and page 2 is 
	   hidden.  When set to -100% the page 2 shows and page 1 is hidden.  The transition between pages is implemented 
	   using the swipe event in mobileview-js.eclipse.js.  It is important that all pages have the same dimensions.

					<p class="spread">The accumulated work experience presented
						spans a diverse range of competencies involving both electronic
						and software development. The software development in itself is
						diverse. It includes both high level application and low level
						embedded real-time controls. The commercial product experience
						includes plant control system, programmable logic controllers,
						product communication protocol accessories, line isolation
						monitor, electronic breaker test equipment and electronic voting
						machine. The aerospace product experience includes electronic and
						software development for satellite ground stations and testing of
						complex satellite components.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="spread">It is important to understand the
						applicability of the skill levels presented. A skill level
						offering may be too low-level for a required task and could rule
						this service out. That same skill level may be complete and
						sufficient to successfully provide a supporting role for that same
						task that could could help achieve a critical schedule milestone.
						The goal of this service is to provide high quality engineering
						assistance that fills a resource gap for your offer process.</p>
