unscripted-ToolHomePage.html: HTML Tool Chain.

unscripted-ToolHomePage.html is content displayed in the detail section of the main page that explains the tool chain
used to create the static web pages for OLD TUG.  
This and all other web content on this site was hand written by me, John Hunsberger, to demonstrate some simple but 
elegant techniques.  This content is open for anyone to copy.  If you have questions about any of this content feel 
free to ask me.  The ideas presented are not invention, they are my application.

						<p class="spread">There are two basic tools used to create and
							maintain the web content for OLD TUG. It is a
							fact that the entire project could be done using just a text
							editor but that approach would be difficult to organize and
							navigate effectively. The following tools are not my preference
							but they are sufficient for this static web project. There are a
							number of IDE's available for web development. Which is best is a
							matter of need and personal preference. For a discussion on
							available IDEs examine the forum discussion at:</p>
						<div style="margin: 0em 0em 0.8em 1em;">

								href="http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/showthread.php?354647-Best-IDE-for-web-development">
								http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/
								showthread.php?354647-Best-IDE-for-web-development</a>
						</div>

						<p class="spread">
							The Eclipse IDE is used as a project explorer and editor for the
							HTML, javascript and CSS files. The Eclipse IDE is free software
							from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse.org</a>.
							Eclipse support for HTML projects offers an internal web browser
							that displays the resulting presentation for a quick
							understanding of the site's behavior. The Eclipse internal
							browser's implementation of the HTML, CSS and Javascript web
							specifications is very consistent with modern browsers. Eclipse
							has specialized editors that offer error checking and
							auto-completion for the document content that is based on the
							corresponding standard. These features are very useful in
							detecting specification errors while constructing the web
							documents.
						</p>

						<p class="spread">
							Debugging with Eclipse is possible but it is not used on this
							project. The Eclipse "<a target="_blank"
								href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/jsdt/debug/">Javascript
								Development Tools Debug</a>" (JSDT) project offers the debugger
							capability. In a large production environment it may be necessary
							to have debug include both the server side and browser
							information. The development support required for the static web
							pages used for OLD TUG does not require any
							server side support. The debug tools built into Chrome and
							Firefox are used to debug the display formats and javascrpt
							methods for this static site's documents.

						</div>
						<p class="spread">
							<span class="StepSection">Step 1: The 'Project Explorer'
								is on the left side of the Eclipse workspace. Right click on the
								desired HTML file in the 'Project Explorer' that is to be
								displayed. In the pop-up use Open With> Web Browser</span>
						</p>
						<div class="AsideSection">If the default browser has been

						<br>
						<p class="spread">
							<span class="StepSection">Step 2: Chrome version 55.x is
								currently used. Notice that there is an icon displayed in the
								top right corner having three vertically positioned dots. When
								the cursor is hovered on this icon it will display "Customize
								and control Google Chrome". Click on this tool icon to display
								the option list. Select More tools> Developer tools.</span>
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="spread">
							<span class="StepSection">Step 3: The browser display will
								reconfigure to the web development view. This view contains two
								main configurable views consisting of a left side HTML rendering
								view and right side debugger tool view. The right side debugger
								view will reconfigure depending on which project data is
								selected from the top menu bar. This menu bar contains the
								entries {inspector icon, toggle device icon, Elements, Console,
								Sources, Network, Timeline, Profiles, Application, Security,
								Audits}.</span>
						</p>
						<div class="SubstepSection">
							3a: The default dimension used to render the HTML view may not be
							the correct proportion for the HTML content. This view pane can
							be resized and adjusted to the desired dimension.<br> <br>
							3b: The default rendering of the selected HTML file is a
							non-mobile display. If the content is intended for a mobile
							browser then the display must be switched to 'responsive'. To do
							that use the 'toggle device icon' in the menu bar at the top of
							the debugger view. After changing to the responsive view right
							click in the view and select Reload. This will cause the view to
							be reformatted.<br> <br>
							<div class="AsideSection">
								<strong><u>Important note:</u></strong> When the the Chrome
								debugger is reconfigured to a responsive view it will lie about
								what browser it is. In the non-mobile configuration Chrome will
								respond to 'navigator.userAgent' as "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT
								6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
								Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36". In the mobile configuration
								the same inquiry gets the response "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android
								5.0; SM-G900P Build/LRX21T) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like
								Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Mobile Safari/537.36". This permits
								the javascript to identify the browser as a mobile one and
								respond by displaying a different document designed for a mobile
								browser. <strong>This is not the case with Firefox</strong>.
							</div>
							<br> Also note that in the 'responsive' view it is possible
							to select a particular display format corresponding to a popular
							mobile device. To do this click on the menu bar at the top of the
							mobile view that reads 'Responsive' and choose one of {Galaxy 55,
							Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad, iPad
							Pro, Edit...}.<br> <br> 3c: Choose the "Elements" entry
							in the menu bar at the top of the right side debugger view to
							display the source HTML information from the selected HTML file.
							Use the 'Sources' menu item in the menu bar to view the
							associated image, script and style file contents.<br> <br>
							3d: When the 'Elements' debug view of the document is displayed
							the cursor can be placed over the top of the named element (such
							as &lt;div&gt;) and the rendering view on the left side will
							highlight that element. This is great for working through
							formatting issues.<br> <br> 3e: When the 'Sources' view
							of a script file content is displayed a break point can be placed
							into a script by clicking on the line number of the desired
							script line. During the processing of the web content the break
							point may then be triggered. During the break in execution it is
							possible to interrogate the values of the various variables. The
							debugger control icons are placed just below the "Sources" file
							list. This consists of six tool icons, left to right {Pause
							script execution, Step over next function call, Step into next
							function call, Step out of current function, Deactivate
							breakpoints, Pause on exceptions}.

								Click on this tool icon to display the option dialog box. Click
								on the "Developer" icon then choose "Toggle Tools".</span><br> <br>
							<span class="StepSection">Step 3: The browser display will
								reconfigure to the web development view. This view contains two
								main configurable views consisting of a top side HTML rendering
								view and bottom side debugger tool view. By default the debugger
								view is displayed at the bottom of the page. The bottom side
								debugger view will reconfigure depending on which project data
								is selected from the top menu bar. This menu bar contains the
								entries {Inspector, Console, Debugger, Style Editor,
								Performance, Memory, Network, iFrame select icon, split console
								toggle icon, responsive design icon, toolbox options icon, dock
								side view icon, show separate window icon, close developer
								icon}. </span>
						</p>
						<br>
						<div class="AsideSection">
							3a: The initial use of the bottom half of the browser's screen
							for the debugger is not an issue. A nice feature is that the
							debugger view can be changed to a side dock or an independent
							window. That helps to display the desired dimension to the
							browser view of the selected HTML file. There is a menu bar at
							the top of the debug view. At the extreme right side are a
							collection of tool icons. The very last tool icon is an 'X' that
							is used to close the debug window. Use the tool icon immediately
							to the left of the close tool icon to switch to a separate debug
							window. When the cursor hovers over this tool icon the "Show in
							separate window" is displayed. Use the tool icon immediately to
							the left of the "Show in separate window" icon to dock the debug
							view to the right side of the browser window. When the cursor
							hovers over this tool icon the "Dock to side of browser window"
							is displayed.<br> <br> 3b: The default rendering of the
							selected HTML file is a non-mobile display. If the content is
							intended for a mobile browser then the display must be switched
							to the 'Responsive Design Mode'. In the right side of the menu
							bar at the top of the debug view there are a number of tool
							icons. The tool icon positioned third from the left will toggle
							the HTML rendering between the non-mobile and mobile views. While
							the debug view is docked in the bottom of the browser view the
							cursor can hover over this icon and the "Responsive Design Mode"
							is displayed. When the view is undocked in a separate window
							there is no message displayed when the mouse is hovered over this
							icon. Also note that in the 'responsive' view it is possible to
							select a particular display format corresponding to a popular
							mobile device. To do this click on the menu bar at the top of the
							mobile view that reads '320x480' and choose one of {320x480,
							360x640, 768x1024, 800x1280, 980x1280, 1280x600, 1920x900}.<br>
							<br> 3c: Choose the "Inspector" entry in the menu bar at the
							top of the left side of the debugger view to see how the browser
							renders the document's elements. The debugger displays the HTML
							source in the bottom left panel. When the cursor is hovered over
							each section of the HTML source the debugger will highlight the
							corresponding formatted element in the HTML rendering view. Use
							the 'Debugger' menu item in the menu bar to view the associated
							javascript and HTML file sources. Each of the associated files
							can be selected from the files list at the left side of the
							Debugger view.<br> <br> 3e: When a javascript file is
							displayed in the 'Debugger' view a break point can be placed into
							a script by clicking on the line number of the desired script
							line. During the processing of the web content the break point
							may then be triggered. During the break in execution it is
							possible to interrogate the values of the various variables. The
							debugger control icons are placed just above the "Sources" file
							list. This consists of four tool icons, left to right {Click to
							pause, Step over, Step in, Step out}.
