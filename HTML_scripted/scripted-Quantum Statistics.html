<p class="paragraph">
In his paper Bose referred to the earlier work by Max Planck in 1901 who derived a relationship between radiation density of a blackbody at thermal equilibrium and the mean energy of an oscillator.
Bose credited Planck's work as the starting point for quantum theory.
However he indicated that the <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99; white-space: nowrap;"><i>8&pi;&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>d&nu;/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup></i></span> factor in Planck's radiation density formula was derived from classical theory and therefore was unsatisfactory.
The main point of Bose's new derivation was to arrive at this same result without the reliance on classical theory, but rather by using a statistical derivation of the density of a black-body spectral emission.
His new approach is explained in his 1924 paper.
To make his paper a bit more accessible to most readers the following discussion of his 1924 paper is presented.
Note that equations that have a yellow highlighted backgrounds are exactly the same equations that Bose presented in his publication.
In addition, these equations are presented in the same order that they appear in his publication.

Bose began his paper by stating that the condition that must be met is the existing formula for radiation density as a function of energy.
That formula for light density at a specific frequency &nu; was <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99; white-space: nowrap;"><i>&rho;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">&nu;</sub>d&nu;=(8&pi;&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>d&nu; / c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>)E</i></span>.
This formula states that the spectral density at a specific frequency <i>&rho;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">&nu;</sub></i> corresponding to each small increment of frequency <i>d&nu;</i> is equal to the total energy <i>E</i> times the scaling facor (8&pi;&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>d&nu; / c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>).
<div class="_Aside"> <!-- ASIDE -->
<span class="aside">Aside:</span><i> &nbsp;Don't be confused by the use of '<i>&nu;</i>' in the Bose equations for frequency.
Planck's equation is sometimes presented using the letter '<i>f</i>' for frequency, but Planck originally wrote this formula as <i>E=h&nu;</i>.
The '&nu;' character for frequency tends to be used interchangeably with '<i>f</i>'. 
There is a discussion regarding the use of '<i>&nu;</i>' or '<i>f</i>' at <a target="_blank" href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/23860/when-to-use-f-and-when-nu-signifying-frequency">The Stack Exchange</a>.
</i><br>
</div> <!-- /ASIDE -->
<p class="paragraph">
Max Planck had previously established in 1900 that for each quanta with the frequency <i>f</i> the energy would be given by <i>E=hf</i>.
Bose based the total energy <i>E</i> having N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub> quanta on Plank's formula.
He expressed that relationship as <i>E=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>h&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>)</i>.
That states that the total energy <i>E</i> is the sum over all quanta frequencies.
For each frequency the energy contribution is the number of quanta (<i>N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i>) at that frequency <i>&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i> times Plank's energy formula.
The summation for total energy <i>E</i> is defined over a range of <i>s</i>, <i>s</i>=0 to <i>s</i>=&infin;.
He equated this summation to the integration formula <i>E=V &int;&rho;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">v</sub>dv</i>.&nbsp; 
The integral means that the total energy <i>E</i> is comprised of all individual spectral densities <i>&rho;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">&nu;</sub></i> at each frequency &nu; times the volume <i>V</i> that contains all of the quanta particles.
His explanation established the energy equalities <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99; white-space: nowrap;"><i>E=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>h&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>)</i>=<i>V &int;&rho;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">v</sub>dv</i></span>.&nbsp; 
Be aware that in his translated paper they used subscripts and superscripts interchangeably, so N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub> is the same as N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>.

<div class="_Aside"> <!-- ASIDE -->
<span class="aside">Aside:</span><i> &nbsp;In the previous paragraph the symbols &Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub> and &int; were introduced.
The symbol &Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub> is the mathematical notation for a successive summation over an incremental range of values indexed by the values of <span style="font-size: 80%;">s</span>.
The <span style="font-size: 80%;">s</span> index is generally supplied with both initial and terminal values to define the range of the summation.
The symbol &int; is the mathematical notation for the integration operator.
In the case above the integral function is given by '&rho;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">v</sub>'.
The operator &int; is often used with a start and end range over which the area is to be computed.
The operator performs the area computation within the function's plot with respect to the function's zero axis.
That base for the integration is indicated by the appended notation "dx" which is read "the change in x".
Integral operators can be presented as multiples like &int;&int;&int;dx dy dz which would be the arbitrary area of a three dimensional region for a function with changes in x, y and z.

<p class="paragraph">
Bose wrote that in order to evaluate the energy equality <i>E=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>hv<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>)</i>=<i>V &int;&rho;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">v</sub>dv</i>, it is necessary to find those numbers <i>N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i> for each frequency <i>&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i> that determine its spectral density <i>&rho;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">&nu;</sub></i>.
He reasoned that there would be many possible probability distribution curves resulting from the various combinations of <i>N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i> values.
He pointed out that the solution for the correct value of <i>N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i> can be found where the probability distribution curve has a maximum and still satisfies the energy equality.
These conditions are the constraints used in finding the final form of the derivation formula.
He added that each quanta has a momentum of <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99; white-space: nowrap;"><i>p<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>=h&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>/c</i></span> in the direction of its motion.
<div class="_Aside"> <!-- ASIDE -->
<span class="aside">Aside:</span><i> &nbsp;For some it might be interesting to see how Bose obtained his momentum formula for each quanta.
The quanta momentum formula just given is derived from the momentum formula (mass times velocity) <i>p=mV</i>, Planck's law <i>E=h&nu;</i> and Einstein's <i>E=mc<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup></i>.
Note that in the momentum formula <i>V</i> is Velocity and not the total Volume of Bose's formula.
First equate the energy formulas <i>h&nu;=mc<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup></i>.
Then rearrange to obtain an expression for mass as <i>m=h&nu;/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup></i>.
Substitute this mass into the momentum formula <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>p=(h&nu;/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>)V</i></span>.
For quanta the velocity <i>V</i> is the speed of light <i>c</i>.
The substitution of <i>c</i> for <i>V</i> in  <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>p=(h&nu;/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>)V</i></span> allows the <i>c</i> value introduced in the numerator to cancel one c value of the <i>c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup></i> in the denominator.
The final expression is then <i>p<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>=h&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>/c</i>.
</i><br>
</div> <!-- /ASIDE -->
<p class="paragraph">
Given that each quanta has both a position within <i>V</i> and a momentum that dictates its next position, he characterized each quanta contributing to the spectral density using three location coordinates and three momentum values (one momentum value for each coordinate axis).
The three location coordinates define the quanta's position using x, y, and z coordinates.
Then using these same coordinate axes he defined the three momentum components as p<sub style="font-size: 80%;">x</sub>, p<sub style="font-size: 80%;">y</sub> and p<sub style="font-size: 80%;">z</sub>.
For any incremental change of the quanta there is a corresponding change in all these six values.
Bose stated that these six values comprise the volume of a six dimensional phase space domain.
The volume of the phase space domain is equal to the integral of all the incremental changes, <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99">&int; dx dy dz dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">x</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">y</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">z</sub></span>.
This six dimensional formula can be viewed as the product of two separate three dimensional formulas.
</p><p class="paragraph">
The triple integral of the three position changes, &int;&int;&int;dx dy dz, represents a volume <i>V</i>.
The triple integral of the three momentum changes, &int;&int;&int;dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">x</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">y</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">z</sub>, is also regarded as a volume within the momentum phase space that is equivalent to the incremental increase of a spherical shape.
The three momentum components all change from their initial vector magnitudes p to new magnitudes corresponding to the change p+dp.
The spherical increase in the vector space describes a shell in the three positional dimensions.
The spherical shell shape of the incremental increase permits the change without regard to a specific direction.
The volume of the spherical shell is obtained by multiplying the surface area of the sphere<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 1)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></span> having a radius of <i>p</i> times the thickness of the shell which is the incremental increase <i>dp</i>.
This then gives the formula &int;&int;&int;dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">x</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">y</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">z</sub>=4&pi;(p<sup style="font-size:70%;">2</sup>) dp.
As previously stated, Bose defined the magnitude of the momentum p<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub> as h&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>/c.
Substituting the value of p<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub> into the integral equation yields &int;&int;&int;dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">x</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">y</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">z</sub>=4&pi;(h&nu;/c)<sup style="font-size:70%;">2</sup> d(h&nu;/c).
Bose stated that the quanta particle's frequency forces it to remain on the cylindrical surface.
He stated that there is then a correspondence between a change in the frequency domain (<span style="background-color: #ffff99; color: red; font-weight: bold;">d&nu;</span>) to a change in the phase space domain (<span style="background-color: #ffff99; color: red; font-weight: bold;">dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">xyz</sub></span>).
He wrote the formula for the quanta's momentum change as <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;">&int;&int;&int;<span style="background-color: #ffff99; color: red; font-weight: bold;">dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">x</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">y</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">z</sub></span>=4&pi;(h&nu;/c)<sup style="font-size:70%;">2</sup> ((h <span style="color: red;">d&nu;</span>)/c)</span>.
By squaring the individual members of the (h&nu;/c)<sup style="font-size:70%;">2</sup> term and combining the like terms, the final form of the equation can be written as <i>4&pi;(h<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>) d&nu;</i>.
He concluded this part of his analysis by combining the volume times the momentum to depict the volume of the phase space domain as a function of frequency as <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>&int; dx dy dz dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">x</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">y</sub> dp<sub style="font-size: 80%;">z</sub>=4&pi;(h<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>) V d&nu;</i></span>.
This final formula equates the frequency domain equivalent to his phase space domain.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Bose then divided up the phase space into individual cells.
His proposed set of cells represented the number of possible arrangements of individual quantum particles having the frequency &nu; positioned within the phase space volume.
This approach was significant to his derivation.
By treating quantum particles as being indistinguishable he departed from the prevailing wisdom of his time which arithmetically treated quantum particles as unique hertzian oscillators.
To develop the statistical treatment Bose created a method to implement counts and probable distributions.
</p><p class="paragraph">

He stated that the number of phase space cells must match the total number of possible arrangements for each quantum particle within the phase space.
The minimal energy change of a photon was given by Max Planck's equation '<i>E=h&nu;</i>'.
Planck had previously established the constant <i>h</i> as the discrete incremental change of energy for each quantum.
Bose used the minimal energy change to assign the volume of each cell of the phase space as <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>h<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup></i></span>.
To compute the total number of unique cells in the domain per frequency &nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub> he divided the frequency domain formula equivalent of the phase space by the <i>h<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup></i> volume to obtain 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>4&pi;(&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>)V d&nu;</i></span>.
Curiously, Bose stated in this article, "<i>Concerning the kind of subdivision of this type, nothing definitive can be said.</i>"
He then indicated that to account for polarization, the count formula must be multiplied by 2.
On page 3 of his article Bose wrote the final formula for the number of unique cells in phase space for a given frequency <i>&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i> as 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>8&pi;(&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">s</sub>/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>)V d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i></span>.
On page 4 Bose established the equation for the variable 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=8&pi;(&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">s</sub>/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>) d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i></span>.
It is subtle point to make, but observe that in this definition of <i>&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i> it is not distributed over the volume V.
</p><p class="paragraph">

Having defined his mathematical model Bose then began his statistical derivation.
Given <i>N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i> quanta within each increment of frequency <i>d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i>, the question that he next addressed was in how many ways can the <i>N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i> quanta be distributed into the <i>Q<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i> number of cells?
To start, he defined a sequence of cell types such that for each frequency &nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub> the cells can be defined as <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;">p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">0</sub> (a cell that contains no quanta), p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">1</sub> (a cell that contains one quanta), p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">2</sub> (a cell that contains two quanta)</span>, and so on.
The sum of this series is equal to the total number of quanta sharing the same frequency corresponding to the increment of frequency d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>.
This is expressed by the formula 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=0p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">0</sub> + 1p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">1</sub> + 2p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">2</sub> + 3p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">3</sub> + &hellip;</i></span>.
The sum of terms in this expression can be rewritten using the summation operator &Sigma; as <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(rp<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r</sub>)</i></span>.
Bose refers to this summation form later in his derivation process.

</p><p class="paragraph">
Bose explained that for each frequency change <i>d&nu;</i>, the number of ways that the total quanta can be distributed into these cell types without regard to order is given statistically by the binominal coefficient<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 2)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></span> '<span style="font-size: 80%;">n</span>C<span style="font-size: 80%;">k</span>'.
Using the binominal coefficient to determine the number of ways quanta with the same frequency <i>&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i> can populate the total kinds of cells was expressed by the equation

Some explanation is needed to explain how Bose used the Stirling Approxiation to produce the new form.
The initial formula 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>W=&Pi;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>! / p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">0</sub>! p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">1</sub>! p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">2</sub>!&hellip;)</i></span> can also be expressed as 
<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>W=&Pi;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>! / &Pi;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r</sub>!))</i></span> by gathering the series multiplication in the denominator.
The successive products of fractions is equivalent to the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators.
Using this simple rule the equation becomes 
<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>W=&Pi;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>!) / &Pi;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&Pi;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r</sub>!))</i></span>.

<span class="aside">Aside:</span><i> &nbsp;Exponentiation and logarithms may be unfamiliar to some.
The logarithm and exponent functions are related mathematical operators.
An exponent is an argument to a numeric value in some base (typically base 10) that specifies a count of multiplications of the value by the base such as 5<sub style="font-size: 70%;">(10)</sub>E+1=50.
The logarithm has the opposite effect of an exponent in that it produces a value less than its argument.
By definition the '<i>log<sub style="font-size: 80%;">base</sub>(N)=Result</i>' is equivalent to <i>base<sup style="font-size: 80%;">Result</sup>=N</i>.
So the logarithm is a function on a numeric base that specifies the count of the number of divisions by the base that exist in the argument.

Bose took the natural logarithm<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 7)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></span> of both sides of the equation for <i>W</i> to produce the new equation

The variable <i>&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i> was defined by Bose to represent the total number of arrangements of a single quanta with a given frequency change <i>d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i>.
The total number of arrangements that the variable <i>&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i> represents must be equal to the total count of quanta distributed into the cells.

By this point in his paper Bose has established a counting model based on the theoretical number of cells within a phase space.
The cells represent a range of change in individual discrete frequencies over the spectrum of quanta present within the phase space volume.
He established that more than one quanta can occupy a single cell space, which means that these quanta are not distinguishable from one another.
To establish his final solution he pointed out that the probability of cell populations over all the frequencies defined by the formula <span style="font-weight: bold;"><i>ln(W)</i></span> must be solved for the maximum of the probability distribution.
To express this maximum probability he used the optimization method called the Lagrange multiplier<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 8)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></span>. 

<div class="_Aside"> <!-- ASIDE -->
<span class="aside">Aside:</span><i> &nbsp;The Lagrange method (Lagrange Multipliers) is a method for finding a local minimum or maximum for a function.
The Lagrange method is used when functionally related constraints are defined.
The method is credited to Lagrange because of his book published in 1788 on analytical approaches to mechanics titled 'M&eacute;canique Analytique'.
In his book he presented an analytic alternative for solving mechanics problems in place of the geometric approach explained in Netwon's 1687 publication <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica">'Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica'</a>.
Lagrange's analytical method for statics was to determine the STATIC STATE that exists when the applied forces are comprised of arbitrary forces.
In the static case the net sum of the applied forces must be zero.
In a similar manner the statistical maximum of a distribution sought by Bose is also a static system in thermal equilibrium consisting of related functions whose sum of the derivatives must be equal to zero.
So the method of undetermined coefficients employed by Lagrand to solve the static state is applied by Bose to find the maximum.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an English translation of Lagrange's book titled <a target="blank" href="https://ia800207.us.archive.org/35/items/springer_10.1007-978-94-015-8903-1/10.1007-978-94-015-8903-1.pdf">'Analytical Mechanics'</a> by AUGUSTE BOISSONNADE and VICTOR N. V AGLIENTE.
In the preface to the translation the authors wrote, "Lagrange's effort was to bring a large portion of what was known about mechanics in his day under one principle - the Principle of Virtual Work."
Virtual work was Lagrange's concept of work not actually done, but rather work that would be done if a static system became perturbed.
A <a target="blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/statics">static system</a> is a stationary state of an object having all applied forces in equilibrium.
On page 29 of his book the static state is expressed as the sum of forces along their lines of application to their force center as <span style="white-space: nowrap;">"P dp+Q dq+R dr+&hellip;=0."</span>
In SECTION IV page 59 Lagrange explains that "to preserve the equilibrium of the static state various equations of condition [functionally related constraints] are required which are given by the nature of the system."
This discussion leads up to his introduction of 'undetermined coefficients' which Lagrange applies to create the 'General Equation of Equilibrium'.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a good discussion regarding the history of the Lagrange multipliers at the <a target="blank" href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/769437/history-of-lagrange-multipliers">stack exchange</a>. 
For more details there is a paper that was published in the "JOURNAL OF OPTIMIZATION THEORY AND APPLICATIONS" by P. Bussotti titled <a target="blank" href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~knill/teaching/summer2014/exhibits/lagrange/genesis_lagrangemultpliers.pdf">'On the Genesis of the Lagrange Multipliers'</a>.

</i><br>
</div> <!-- /ASIDE -->

<p class="paragraph">
As a first step to apply the Lagrange method Bose recalled the constraints that he established at the beginning of his paper.
His first constraint was <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99"><i>E=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>h&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>)</i></span> for the total energy.
The second constraint was with regard to the count of the total number of quanta sharing the same frequency corresponding to the increment of frequency d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>. 
For this he specified that <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(rp<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r</sub>)</i></span>.
He next wrote, "Carrying out the variation gives the condition..."
It is presumed that by his use of the word 'variation' Bose meant that the variables of the function formula he obtained for <span style="font-weight: bold;"><i>ln(W)</i></span> must vary in relation to the constraints just mentioned to locate the maximum of the system.
That variation then depends on several parameters of the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><i>ln(W)</i></span> function.
</p><p class="paragraph">
It is necessary to find the values of these parameters for which the expectation value of the energy is the highest possible.
Each of the parameters would produce a maximum where the derivative of its function is zero.
The derivative of any function is the expression of the slope of the tangent at every point on the function.
Where the tangential slope of the function becomes zero the function is horizontal to the its base axis.
This happens at a maximum or a minimum as the local function value trend reverses, either decreasing or increasing.
</p><p class="paragraph">
To find the desired maximum for <span style="font-weight: bold;"><i>ln(W)</i></span> he used three inter-dependent functions.  
He set each of their individual derivatives to zero in order to define their separate maximums:
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(&delta;p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r</sub>(1+ln(p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub>))))=0</i></span>, 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&delta;N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>)=0</i></span>  and
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(&delta;p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub>)=0</i></span>.
In the first and third derivative functions the change is with respect to a change of the values of the cell divisions <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub></i></span>.
In the second derivative function the change is with respect to the total number of quanta sharing the same frequency <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i></span>, however he reminds the reader that <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>&delta;N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(r&delta;p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub>)</i></span>.
So substituting <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(r&delta;p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub>)</i></span> for <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>&delta;N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i></span> in the second equation then completes a set of three equations maximized with respect to a change in <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub></i></span>.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Precisely how Bose obtained his first derivative function could not be determined for this article.
It appears that the first derivative function may have been obtained by some variation of the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><i>ln(W)</i></span> formula.
He may have found a way to eliminate some terms because the derivative of a constant is always zero.
The second derivative function maximizes his first constraint on the total energy <span style="font-weight: bold;"><i>E</i></span>.
The third derivative function maximizes the number of arrangements of a single quanta at each increment of frequency <span style="font-weight: bold;"><i>A<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i></span>.
So Bose completed the preliminary step to the Lagrange method by establishing three interdependent derivative equations where each changes incrementally with respect to the same variable.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Bose substituted <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(r&delta;p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub>)</i></span> for <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>&delta;N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i></span> in <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&delta;N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>)</i></span> to produce the equation <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(r&delta;p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub>)h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>)</i></span>.
He rearranged the product within the summation &Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>() as <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup> &Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(r&delta;p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub>))</i></span>.
Using this new derivative formula and the first and third derivative formulas he multiplied these three derivative formulas with Lagrange multipliers and summed them.
Applying the Lagrange multipliers (1), &lambda; and 1/&beta; produced the equation  
<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>(1)&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(&delta;p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r</sub>(1+ln(p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub>)))) + 
&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&lambda;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup> &Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(&delta;p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r</sub>)) +

</i></span>
By combining the first and second terms the final equation becomes
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(&delta;p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r</sub>(1+ln(p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub>) + &lambda;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>))) +

</p><p class="paragraph">
At this point of his paper Bose stated "From this we get the next step..." and introduces the equation
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub>=B<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>exp(-rh&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)</i></span>.
Note that at this point the translators introduced a new variable 'B<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>' without definition.
It cannot be explained here how this derivation was performed.
Given that Einstein had reviewed and approved Bose's derivation lends sufficient trust that the work is valid.
However, in the periodical 'Current Science, Vol. 69 (10 July 1995)' published by Current Science Association is an article by S.K Das and S. Sengupta titled <a target="blank" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24096635?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">"Professor S. N. Bose's contribution to quantum statistics - A critical review"</a>.
On page 76 of this article the authors noted about Bose's derivation, "<i>It is really surprising that neither Bose nor Einstein in their first paper considered it necessary to examine critically the derivation of the new expression for thermodynamic probability.</i>"
There is a hint towards this mysterious step offered in that same article, "<i>In the logarithmic derivative of W, one has to use this condition [that Z<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup> (expressed as A<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup> in Bose's article) is constant]"</i>.
Recall that <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r</sub>)</i></span>.
The derivative of a constant is zero.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Substituting the new form of <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub></i></span> into the &Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup> equation yields 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(B<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>exp(-rh&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;))</i></span>.
&nbsp;&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup> is the count of arrangements of a single quanta having an incremental change in the specific frequency &nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>.
The equation is a sum over all integer values for r from zero to infinity.
The general <a target="blank" href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/sequences-sums-geometric.html">geometric series</a> formula to be applied is <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(ak<sup style="font-size: 80%;">r</sup>)=a[(1-k<sup style="font-size: 80%;">r</sup>)/(1-k)]</span> for r=0 to n.
Using the exponent law <span style="white-space: nowrap;">x<sup style="font-size: 80%;">ab</sup>=(x<sup style="font-size: 80%;">a</sup>)<sup style="font-size: 80%;">b</sup></span>
the &Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup> formula's 'k' value can be expressed as exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)<sup style="font-size: 80%;">-r</sup>.
Since the exponent value r is negative the value exp(k<sup style="font-size: 80%;">r</sup>) will vanish as r becomes large.
In the general formula it can be seen that when k<sup style="font-size: 80%;">n</sup> becomes zero the formula in this case becomes essentially <i>a[(1)/(1-k)]</i>.
The sum for &Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup> becomes <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>B<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>[1/(1-exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;))]</i></span>.
Solving for the constant B<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup> (written B<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>) gives 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>B<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>=&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>[1-exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)]</i></span>.
</p><p class="paragraph">
At this point Bose recalls that 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(rp<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r</sub>)</i></span>.
By using the previous equation 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>p<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r&nbsp;</sub>=B<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>exp(-rh&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)</i></span>
the equation 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(rp<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">r</sub>)</i></span> 
becomes 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(rB<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>exp(-rh&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;))</i></span>.
Substituting for B<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup> then gives 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(r&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>[1-exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)]exp(-rh&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;))</i></span>.
Using the summation identity <i>&Sigma;(Cf(n))=C&Sigma;(f(n))</i> the constant value &Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>[1-exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)] can be removed from the summation to give
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>[1-exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)]&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub>(rexp(-rh&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;))</i></span>.
Again applying the rules of geometric series for the summation &Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">r</sub> and the convergence as r approaches infinity this becomes
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>[exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)] / (1-exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)</i></span>.
</p><p class="paragraph">

At the end of page 5 Bose concluded the derivation.
He first returned to the energy equality <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>E=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>h&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>)</i></span> established at the beginning of his paper.
There is now an expression for the total number of quanta sharing the same frequency corresponding to the increment of frequency  <i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i> (also written <i>N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i>).
He recalls here the definition <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=8&pi;(&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">s</sub>/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>)d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub></i></span>.
Substituting for the <i>&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i> in the <i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i> equation that was just obtained produces the equation
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>=8&pi;(&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">s</sub>/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>)d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>[exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)/(1-exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)]</i></span>.
Substituting for <i>N<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i> in the energy equation then produces 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>E=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>([8&pi;(&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">s</sub>/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>)d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>[exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)]/(1-exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)]h&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>)</i></span>.
Rearranging terms then produces 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>E=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>([8&pi;h&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">s</sub>]/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup> ([exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)]/[1-exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)]d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>)</i></span>.
The &nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub> terms combine to &nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">s</sub>.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Notice the absence of the volume variable V in this equation.
Recall that on page 3 Bose stated that the total number of cells must be regarded as the number of possible arrangements of one quantum in the given cell volume.
Also recall that on page 4 that <i>&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i> was defined without a volume.
In his phase space formula the phase space change was comprised of both the increment of momentum and the increment of volume.
So the volume must be accounted for. 
It is not clear whether it was silently added here, originally omitted by the translators or whether Bose considered it part of <i>&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup></i>.
The formula for the total energy E given by Bose is finally expressed as 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>E=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>( [8&pi;h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">s</sub>]/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup> V ([exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)] / [1-exp(-h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)] d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>)</i></span>.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Bose next examined the entropy<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 9)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup></span> in the system.
He wrote the entropy as 
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>S=k{(E/&beta;)-&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(&Alpha;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>)ln[1-exp(h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/&beta;)]}</i></span>.
Recall that Bose's article is examining the energy distribution in black body radiation from a system that is at thermal equilibrium. 
In his system the energy is given by the sum of all individual energies from microstates at each frequency change given by  
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; "><i>E=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>(f(&nu;<sub style="font-size: 60%;">s</sub>)d&nu;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>)</i></span>.
The entropy is based on Boltzmann's equation
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;"><i>S=kLog(W)</i></span> where S is entropy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and W is the total number of possible microstates.
Bose concludes that because the change in entropy is equal to the change in energy divided by the constant temperature
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>&part;S/&part;E=1/T</i></span>
then it is correct to conclude that the <i>&beta;</i> variable in his energy equation is equal to <i>kT</i>. 
This then allows that the Bose statistical approach produces the same result as the Planck's formula
<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffff99;"><i>E=&Sigma;<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>((8&pi;h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup><span class="backspace"></span><sub style="font-size: 60%;">s</sub>/c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">3</sup>) V [exp(h&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>/kT)-1]<sup style="font-size: 80%;">-1</sup>d&nu;<sup style="font-size: 80%;">s</sup>)</i></span>.

<div class="_Aside"> <!-- ASIDE -->
<span class="aside">Aside:</span><i> &nbsp;Some readers may be curious how entropy fits this discussion.
The importance arises in two ways.
In the classical physics the understanding of heat transfer systems were written as the laws of thermodynamics.
The first law is the law of the conservation of energy which states that energy of the isolated system can not be created or destroyed.
Given this law it is then necessary to account for the difference between the starting and ending energy.
This is stated in the second law of thermodynamics as entropy.
So for the system state change modeled by Bose the energy change results in an entropy value.
He represents the entropy in terms of his micro states N<sub style="font-size: 80%;">s</sub>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second importance of entropy to Bose's derivation arises in its prior derivation as a statistical distribution by 
<a target="blank" href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Boltzmann.html">Ludwig Boltzmann</a>.
Around 1872 Ludwig Boltzmann extended Maxwell's statistical analysis of molecular velocities to entropy.
In 1877 he published the paper 'On the Relationship between the Second Fundamental Theorem of the Mechanical Theory of Heat and Probability Calculations Regarding the Conditions for Thermal Equilibrium'. 
An English translation of Boltzmann's paper can be obtained from <a target="blank" href="http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/17/4/1971">here</a>.
Regarding this paper, Dieter Flamm wrote on page 6 of his article <a target="blank" href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/349186/files/9803005.pdf">'<i>History and outlook of statistical physics</i>'</a> that in Boltzmann's prior work, 
"He could show that the entropy S is proportional to the 6N–dimensional phase space volume &Omega; occupied by the corresponding macrostate of an N–particle system".
The similarity between this conceptual model and Bose's model are clear.

		<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the dot product nor the inner product operator is associative 
because the dot and inner product operations between a vector and a scalar is not defined. 
Each operator is only valid between two vectors.  
However there is a kind of associative definition involving a scalar as shown.
The equality is a combination of the multiply and dot product or inner product operators.
A vector's magnitude is scaled by multiplication with a scaler.
For this associative equality to hold either A or B can be scaled but not both.
The right side of the equality shown scales the B vector by a, but it also holds if the A vector is scaled.</div>

	<div id="fnComplexConjugate" style="display: none;">
		<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner product has its origin in Hamilton's quest for multiplication of complex valued vectors.
The imaginary component of the complex valued vector presents a special case for this operation.
In the case of the dot product from which the inner product is derived, two real valued vectors are the terms of the operation and the result is a single number.
That number represents what magnitude of the first real valued vector exists in the same direction as the second vector.
Ideally the Inner Product binary operator should be commutative the same as the Dot Product, however the commutative property only holds for the complex conjugate of the commuted operation.</div>
