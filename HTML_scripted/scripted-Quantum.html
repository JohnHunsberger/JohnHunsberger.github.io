There are two historical threads presented in this article of the individuals who played important roles towards understanding the physics and mathematics of the electron quantum particle.
The physics and mathematics are intertwined so that progress in one cannot be appreciated without considering the progress in the other.
The main thread follows the progress of the physical experiments and the secondary thread follows the mathematical developments needed to model the experimental results.
The two threads are differentiated by slightly indenting the mathematical contributors.
It is not possible to include all of the historical contributions in this presentation.

The concept that elements are composed of smaller particles was published around 1808<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 1)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()" onclick="linkGOTO(this, 1)"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></span> by John Dalton.
His work with the 'weights' of gases suggested that there exists a unique atom for each element and that elements exist as aggregates of these fundamental parts.
He proposed that atoms are measurable particles and that all elements conform to what he called the system of "atomic weights".
The formalization of the idea that all matter is composed of atoms was the first important step towards identifying the subatomic structures and developing theories to explain their properties and behaviors.
It is curious how the evidences for the existence of subatomic particles and their behaviors arose from so many different physical investigations, in particular astronomy.

Lagrange and Poisson were working on the dynamics of the motion of planets.
Kepler proposed in early 1600 that observed planetary motion can be regarded mathematically as a path upon a smooth elliptical surface resulting from a definable mechanical system.
Around 1809 both Lagrange<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 60)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn60">[60]</a></sup></span> and Poisson simultaneously investigated the mathematics for the motion on a curved surface.
They used classical mechanics to derive orbitals as a combination of the many forces describing a planet's path.
Motion on an eliptical path can be viewed as the result of many small incremental changes from one coordinate to the next.
Depicting the motion between two points on the orbital path as having a flat coordinate system allows the incremental change to be described as the consequence of the sum of the incremental changes of the component forces.
This kind of local representation is called a manifold<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 27)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn27">[27]</a></sup></span>.
This perspective is similar to viewing a trip from one place to another on a flat road map when in fact the earth is not flat.
Their effort resulted in defining the composition laws called the Poisson bracket.
The Poisson bracket can be thought of as a binary operation on two sets of coordinates that maps the first set to the second.
It has the notation (a, b)<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 26)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn26">[26]</a></sup></span>.
The work by Lagrange and Poisson is extended later by William Hamilton to introduce a new means to express mechanics.

In 1833 William Hamilton created a new mathematical formulation for Newtonian mechanics called Hamiltonian mechanics.
The prior work by Poisson played an important role in the Hamiltonian mechanics<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 24)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup></span>.
Hamilton's new mechanics depicted any change described by the classical Newtonian mechanics as a transition within a coordinate system, from one coordinate position to another.
At each coordinate position the total energy is described by two independent energy functions T and V where T+V=ℋ.
The 'ℋ' is the Hamiltonian symbol.  The Hamiltonian represents the total energy in the system (kinetic 'T' plus potential 'V').
The energy functions T and V are independent of each other such that at time <i>t</i>, the value of T is a function of p, f1(p, t), and the value of V is a function of q, f2(q, t).
The result is a three axis depiction of mechanics T, V, and <i>t</i> that represents mechanical change of T and V over time <i>t</i> as a curved path in 3D space.
The 3D space is called the phase space because it represents all of the phases of the mechanical system's transitions with respect to time<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 25)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn25">[25]</a></sup></span>.

For example a ring size can vary from 3 to 9.
The items mentioned are associated by all being worn by a person, though for any one person their set of size values will vary from others.
If the set of values considered consisted only of rings then the space for that value range would be a line starting with 3 and ending with 9.
If shoes are included with rings, having values from 6 to 16, then the phase space becomes a plane with a volume of 60.
If there is a person who has both tight shoes and a loose ring and changes their shoe size from 9 to 10 and their ring from 5 to 4 then two things.

<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">[1843] William Hamilton</a> <span style="color: maroon;">&nbsp;The definition of Quaternians.</span><br>
The introduction of complex and imaginary numeric values dates back to around 1828 when Carl Friedrich Gauss introduced them<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 36)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn36">[36]</a></sup></span>.
In 1843 Hamilton perceived a difficulty with the arithmetic treatment of the imaginary numbers.
He detailed an algebra of couples by defining the usual algebraic operations on these numeric pairs.
He then concluded his theory of couples by applying it to imaginary numbers where (a + b<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">&nbsp;-1&nbsp;</span></span>) becomes the couple (a,b).
By his couples notation <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">&nbsp;-1&nbsp;</span></span>=(0,1).
Hamilton wanted to extend the algebra of couples to three dimensional constructs called triplets.
He encountered a difficulty defining multiplication of the imaginary values.
In order to complete the required algebraic rules for triplets he was led to the numerical construct he called quaternions.
His quaternion structure extended the triplet by one additional dimension.
In his article in Philosophical Magazine, (1844–1850) titled <a target="blank" href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/OnQuat/OnQuat.pdf">"ON QUATERNIONS, OR ON A NEW SYSTEM OF IMAGINARIES IN ALGEBRA"</a> he presented the derivation of a method of multiplication that suspends the pre-existing rule of algebra that multiplication must satisfy the commutative property<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 37)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn37">[37]</a></sup></span>.
The necessary step to accommodate multiplication of imaginary couples and preserve a symmetry in the product (Commutative law) was to define that the product of two complex valued pairs requires forming the complex conjugate of the second term.
This advanced the idea that the multiplication of two imaginary numbers <i>ij</i> is not equal to <i>ji</i> but rather <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>-ji</i></span>.
Hamilton's quaternians were popular for awhile but were supplanted later by <a target="blank" href="https://www.famousscientists.org/j-willard-gibbs/">Josiah Gibbs</a> in 1884 who presented the same operations using vectors<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 63)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn63">[63]</a></sup></span>.

The combined work of Arthur Cayley and James Sylvester's established an algebra based on matrices.
The matrix algebra produced was an extension to the existing algebraic means for the solution of simultaneous linear equations.
In the mid 1800's the collaboration between Arthur Cayley and James Joseph Sylvester on simultaneous linear equations produced a formal mathematical treatment for what Sylvester named the "matrix".
In 1858 Cayley published an article in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (pp. 17-37) titled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/i207013">'Memoir on the Theory of Matrices'</a>.
This publication introduced his theory of matrices for which he stated, "It will be seen that matrices ... comport themselves as single quantite; they may be added, multiplied or compounded together...".
In the introduction Cayley illustrates that the matrix content is composed from the coefficients of a set of linear equations.
On  pg. 31 paragraph number 36, Cayley discusses how one matrix can transpose another.
In this article he gave the transpose matrix the symbol "tr.".
Modern mathematics typically uses the the term 'T' to represent the transpose matrix.

<span class="aside">Aside:</span><i> &nbsp;There may be some who are unfamiliar with the term matrix.
There are many structures in mathematics that can be treated singularly in binary operations despite their apparent complexity.
Depending on how the structure enters into the operation its function has names such as divisor, multiplicand,  transpose, etc.
What all structures have in common is that they represent a state.
It is the practice of mathematics to combine structures according to the laws of their operators such as addition and multiplication.
Over the many years the mathematical structures evolved, adding more complexity as needed.
A matrix structure can be considered to be yet another mathematical structure for which rules for binary operations are defined.
Moreover, the structure is introduced here as an algebra.
Any algebra has universally defined properties for the numerical structure and mathematical operations on it.
To understand the requirements of an algebra refer to the article at <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Basic_Laws_of_Algebra">wikiversity</a>.

Nearly forty years after Hamilton's introduction of the new mechanics representation, Felix Klein published a series of  mathemathical analyses that included the geometries of curved sufaces.
Published in 1872, this collection of his analyses is called the "Erlangen programme".
A part of this work was to depict a curved surface as the result of a group of linear transformations of successive coordinates along the surface.
The transformation group produces successive coordinates that define the system's evolution.
Klein's work produced a means to discover those elements of the mathematical model for the geometry that do not change under a group of transformations<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 29)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup></span>.

One in particular was the invention of the interferometer.
Spectroscopic instruments and their careful use have made important contributions within the historical investigations of the subatomic particles.

Michelson was searching for evidence of the aether wind of space by measuring the effect it had on the propagation of light.
None was found.
It is now known that space consists of a near vacuum with a small amount of hydrogen.

Electron particles were not identified until 1897 when J.J.Thomson's research with charged beams identified the electron particle.
Much later, in 1913, Niels Bohr advanced a model for the atomic structure defining the atomic shells.
According to the Bohr model, the hydrogen atom has numerous electron orbital shells designated by 'n'.
The Bohr model allows the electron to be present in any one of the 'n' shells depending on its energy state.
It is understood now that when the electron absorbs energy it is promoted from its current shell to the next.
Also, when the electron emits a photon it looses energy that results in it being demoted to the next lower shell.
In the case where a photon is emitted, the energy of the emitted photon will match the energy lost in the transition from the higher orbital to the lower one.
Max Planck's work in 1900 related light frequency is to energy by E=hf.
Therefore the spectral line's frequency 'f' will correspond to the particular energy loss by the orbital change.</i><br>

Albert Michelson was asked by the International Committee of Weights and Measures to find a way to measure the standard meter length using light waves.
During the late 1800's he used the interferometer he invented to investigate what light source would be best to establish the number of wavelengths in the stanadard meter.
During his research he examined the light from a hydrogen source.
While studying the light from hydrogen he discovered that the Hα spectral line<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 52)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn52">[52]</a></sup></span> displayed as two spectral lines, a doublet, rather than the expected single red line.

<span class="aside">Aside:</span><i> &nbsp;The importance of this discovery came into focus when Bohr proposed his atomic model in 1913.
Atomic models are comprised of both a physical concept and an attendant mathematical description.
It is an expectation that the model's fitness depends on its mathematical prediction of observable effects.
The Bohr atomic model of 1913 defined quantized energy levels as atomic shells he designated with 'n'.
Bohr modeled electron orbitals as symmetrically circular paths.
Because the energy and angular momentum in the Bohr model is constant it is then expected that the frequency 'f' of the spectral lines would always be single lines.
So the presence of a doublet becomes significant as Physicists begin to work on the fitness of subsequent atomic models.
This specific issue with the atomic model was addressed by Arnold Sommerfeld in 1915 who identified the azimuthal angle.

Max Planck worked with the physics of thermodynamics and black body radiation.
He sought to explain Wilhelm Wien's black body radiation experiments that demonstrated a shift in wavelength proportional to the applied heat.
Influenced by previous work by Heinrich Hertz on the photoelectric effect, he proposed that the observed shift could be explained in terms of atomic vibrations that he modeled using harmonic oscillators<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 16)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup></span>.
While developing his mathematical model Max Planck discovered that it was necessary to establish that the energy change progressed in "discrete" units that he called the energy element '<i>E</i>'.
The discrete energy units were the minimal increment of energy '<i>E</i>' for each Hertzian oscillator in his model.
To adjust his mathematics to match Wien's earlier account of the relationship between the energy and frequency he deduced a porportionality constant '<i>h</i>' <span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 7)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></span>.

Planck's work introduced the important concept of "quantization of energy" but it remained for Einstein to later rationalize this concept.
Einstein redefined the concept of the discrete energy element '<i>E</i>' to be the minimal energy of an electromagnetic wave, or photon.

In his analysis of the spectral density of black body radiation his model was based on a volume of Hertzian oscillators, each of which uniquely contributed to the total energy.

In June of 1905 Einstein published the paper "ON THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES"<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 53)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn53">[53]</a></sup></span>.
This contained his theory of relativity in which he used a moving rod metaphor observed in two distinct frames of reference.
He first established a definition of simultaneity by describing the synchronization of two clocks A and B that are used to establish the time of two linked events, each event at their different locations.
Each clock transmits the time of its event to the other clock position using a beam of light.
Some data is acquired by an observer at each clock at the synchronized time.
It is significant to be able to compare the results of the following frames that the time for the light to travel in both directions is the same.
Einstein then introduced his moving rod metaphor.
The moving rod can be regarded as rather long or else the observers rather small.
At each end of the rod is a pair of synchronized clocks awaiting their event to transmit the time.
Each clock has an observer moving with it.
Someplace forward of the moving rod are two more synchronized clocks that are synchronized with the two on the rod.
Each fixed clock has a stationary observer.
At a simultaneous time <i>t</i> an event triggers the four clocks so the four observers can record the precise position of the rod ends with respect to a parallel coordinate system.
The observers in motion have some velocity <i>v</i> in their frame of reference that impacts the time <i>t</i> that it takes for the light to travel in either direction.
Einstein asserts this to be true because regardless of the rod's velocity and relative motion of its clocks, the light wave propagates at an independent constant velocity <i>c</i>.
Because clock B is moving away from the light at the velocity <i>v</i> the net velocity in the motion frame is reduced to <i>c</i>-<i>v</i>, increasing the duration of time of light travel between the fixed points A and B.
For the same reason the velocity in the direction B to A is increased to <i>c</i>+<i>v</i>, decreasing the duration of time of light traveling back.
But in the stationary frame there is zero velocity and so the light travel times are equal in either direction.
The conclusion is that the observers in motion frame would declare that the clocks were not synchronized by the definition of synchronization given and more importantly, that measurements are relative to their frame of reference.

In September of 1905 Einstein published the short paper "DOES THE INERTIA OF A BODY DEPEND UPON ITS ENERGY-CONTENT?"<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 54)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn54">[54]</a></sup></span>
It was in this publication that Einstein's famous equation E=mc<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup> is credited.
The actual point of his publication was that kinetic energy of a moving body viewed from two frames of reference will be different.
His reasoning follows directly from his previous paper on his theory of relativity.
He begins with an arbitrary body positioned in a three dimensional coordinate system (<i>x,y,z</i>) as a rest frame of reference.
A moving frame having coordinates (<i>&xi;,&eta;,&zeta;</i>) that is parallel to the rest frame is a second frame of reference.
Within the rest frame the body's energy is depicted as E<sub style="font-size: 80%;">0</sub> and in the motion frame the energy is depicted as H<sub style="font-size: 80%;">0</sub>.
If the observed body emits a portion of its energy as light then the amount of energy remaining is different depending on the frame.
The total energy of the body is its kinetic plus its potential.
To preserve the potential energy Einstein proposed that the emission energy within the rest frame is composed of two equal and opposite emissions <i>&frac12;L</i>.
In the rest frame the remaining energy is E<sub style="font-size: 80%;">1</sub> and the motion frame it is H<sub style="font-size: 80%;">1</sub>.
The difference between the two energy values observed in the two frames <i>H-E</i> is then related to differences of their kinetic energy <i>K</i>.
In each frame the original energy is equal to the sum of remaining energy plus the kinetic energy lost by the emission.
Because the emitted energy was defined for the rest frame, the emission energy <i>&frac12;L</i> must be translated to the motion coordinates by the angle between the two frames as the <i>cos(&theta;)</i>.
He performs several steps of algebraic manipulation to represent the difference between the kinetic energy of the two frames K<sub style="font-size: 80%;">0</sub>-K<sub style="font-size: 80%;">1</sub>.
His final representation of the kinetic energy difference between the two frames is given as K<sub style="font-size: 80%;">0</sub>-K<sub style="font-size: 80%;">1</sub>=&frac12;(L/[c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>])<i>v</i><sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>.
Kinetic energy is related to mass and velocity of the body as <i>K=&frac12;mV<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup></i>.
In Einstein's final representation it can be seen that (L/[c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>]) can be viewed as <i>m.</i>
Set <i>m</i>=(L/[c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>]) and rearranging reveals L=<i>m</i>[c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>].
Recall that L was the total energy loss of the body, so E=<i>m</i>c<sup style="font-size: 80%;">2</sup>.

He referred to the circular orbitals as shells and assigned them numbers.
The orbital number '<i>n</i>' was the <b>first identified quantum number</b> assigned to the electron.
The smaller orbitals of the Bohr model were assigned the lesser energy levels and the largest orbitals the greater energy levels.
An electron with a particular energy level resulted in the electron occupying a particular orbital.
As an electron gained or lost sufficient energy it could shift to a higher or lower orbit.
Bohr also reasoned out that each shell can contain a number of electrons with the same energy level.

</p><p class="paragraph">
To explain the location of the shells, Bohr proposed that the electron's energy (angular velocity) and the axial force of charge attraction between the electron and the nucleus holding it in the particular shell determined the radius of a circular arc.

Max Planck previously published his Energy Quanta.

Both Bohr and Sommerfeld were aware of the conflict of Bohr's orbital model with the fine line doublet of the Hα spectral line discovered by Albert Michelson in 1888.
If the electron orbit was circular as proposed by Bohr then the angular velocity would be constant and the expected spectral display of the light emissions would always be single lines.
In 1915 Arnold Sommerfeld proposed a new model to address the existence of Michelson's fine line structure.
He apparently reasoned out that in order to have photon emission with discrete wavelengths slightly offset in frequency from the main Hα emission line while having the same shell <i>'n'</i>, the model required that the electron's orbital energy must be slightly shifted in some instances.

Most important to his new model, Sommerfeld understood Einstein's 1905 publication of relativistic mass.
Because the electron orbital speed (oscillation by earlier accounts) is at near light speed the relativistic mass has an observable effect.
His model allowed for the electron's velocity to vary throughout the elliptical orbit where the electron's velocity was at its greatest in its closest distance to the nucleus and slowest at its greatest distance from the nucleus.
His model's variation in velocity introduced a variation in the electron's angular momentum throughout its orbit.
Accordingly, the relativistic mass of the electron should vary as its speed varies throughout the elliptical orbit.
The introduction of mass variance added slight deflections out of the flat plane of the orbit<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 19)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup></span>.
Sommerfeld defined these precessed orbitals as having discrete offset angles that produced slight shifts in energy corresponding to the discrete fine lines observed by Michelson.
Each angular offset constitutes an azimuthal angle out of the flat plane of orbit and each has slightly different effective energy.
The introduction of the discrete azimuthal angle is the <b>second identified quantum number</b> for electrons and is typically represented as '<i>l</i>'.
Because Sommerfeld's model exploited relativistic mass it is sometimes referred to as the relativistic atomic model.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_quantum_theory
The Bohr model was the focus of study, and Arnold Sommerfeld[3] made a crucial contribution
by quantizing the z-component of the angular momentum, which in the old quantum era was called
space quantization (Richtungsquantelung). This allowed the orbits of the electron to be ellipses
instead of circles, and introduced the concept of quantum degeneracy.

<!--
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_energy_levels
In quantum mechanics, an energy level is degenerate if it corresponds to two or more different measurable states of a quantum system. Conversely, two or more different states of a quantum mechanical system are said to be degenerate if they give the same value of energy upon measurement. The number of different states corresponding to a particular energy level is known as the degree of degeneracy of the level. It is represented mathematically by the Hamiltonian for the system having more than one linearly independent eigenstate with the same energy eigenvalue.[1]:p. 48 In classical mechanics, this can be understood in terms of different possible trajectories corresponding to the same energy.
Degeneracy plays a fundamental role in quantum statistical mechanics. For an N-particle system in three dimensions, a single energy level may correspond to several different wave functions or energy states. These degenerate states at the same level are all equally probable of being filled. The number of such states gives the degeneracy of a particular energy level.

<!-- Nodes occur where the wavefunction is zero.  This is a region in space where the probability of an electron is zero.
Recall from Bohr's first quantum number 'n' that electron orbitals proceeded in discrete radial distances from the nucleus.
A radial node is the circular region between subsequent n shells in which the probability of an electron presence is zero.
An angular node is a planar region. -->

Azimuthal refers to an angular displacement from a line of sight or straight line.
Typical use of this relates to marine navigation where a sextant is used to determine longitude and latitude.
The instrument was introduced around 1731<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 55)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn55">[55]</a></sup></span>.
The following is a very abbreviated description.
A much better explanation can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marineinsight.com/marine-navigation/what-is-a-sextant/">http://www.marineinsight.com/marine-navigation/what-is-a-sextant/</a>.
The sextant instrument can display two images simultaneously side by side.
The first sighting is with the telescope to view the horizon and establish the flat plane of travel.
The sextant's index bar is then adjusted to view a celestial reference object through the index mirror such that its image aligns with the horizon.
The angle between the two objects is the azimuthal angle and it is correlated with the time of the observation to determine position from reference charts.

Otto Stern noted that electrons of the hydrogen atom moving in a rotational orbit around the nucleus should produce a magnetic moment in the same way that current passed through a circular coil of wire does.
That was not supported by the evidence.
To investigate this anomaly the Stern–Gerlach experiment was performed.
Charged particle beams had been used previously by Joseph J. Thomson in 1897 in his research that exposed the ratio between an applied electric charge and the mass of the beam.
Also prior to the Stern-Gerlach experiment, in 1911 <a target="_blank" href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Dunoyer.html">Louis Dunoyer</a> experimented with the luminescence properties of sodium vapors.
Dunoyer discovered that by using the optical slit experimental methods, he was able to create a straight line beam of neutral sodium atoms<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 44)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn44">[44]</a></sup></span>.

In the Stern-Gerlach experiment a beam of silver atoms was passed through a nonuniform magnetic field.
The expectation was that the silver atoms would behave as tiny magnets, interact with the magnetic field, and the beam would become diffused.
Rather than a diffuse deposition on the collector of the atomic beam apparatus, the beam split into only discrete points.
This demonstrated that the magnetic moment of an atom in an external magnetic field can have only a few possible discrete orientation angles with respect to the external field lines.
The magnetic quantum number of an electron is a discrete integer value that is a function of the electron's angular momentum quantum number <i>l</i>.
The magnetic quantum number <i>m<sub style="font-size:70%;">l</sub></i> became <b>the third quantum number</b> assigned to the electron.

The theoretical understanding of quantum states in 1924 was that each state was a strict consequence of the quantum numbers such that the particles strictly adhered to one of the available quantum states.
In this model the quantum particles were presumed to be uniquely distinguishable.
Max Planck had previously used energy quantum and unique quantum states in his mathematical model<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 66)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn66">[66]</a></sup></span> to explain Wilhelm Wien's black body radiation.
His radiation formula defined the amount of emitted radiation (spectral density) of a surface maintained at a constant temperature.
He used a set of unique harmonic oscillators, each one being distinguishable from each other.

<p class="paragraph">
It was significant to Bose that the unique harmonic oscillators entered into Planck's mathematical model as distinguishable contributors<span onmouseover="linkInfoON(this, 67)" onmouseout="linkInfoOFF()"><sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn67">[67]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;
Additionally, Bose objected to the use of classical physics in order to obtain the spectral density formula for black body radiation.
He was able to derive the same result as Planck by using a statistical derivation of the density of a black-body spectral emission.
In his publication <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1994JApA...15....3B/0000003.000.html ">"PLANCK'S LAW AND THE LIGHT QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS"</a> in the American Journal of Physics he explained his approach.

Heisenberg remained skeptical about the theories regarding an atomic orbital.

At the time the orbital distance was regarded as a function of its momentum as related to Bohr's energy element <i>E</i>,  Thomson's mass and Planck's constant <i>h</i>.
Heisenberg's approach to electron orbitals was more a statistical representation by using data from spectroscopy measurements over time and expressed the transitions by square arrays.
The matrix algebra employed had been defined by Cayley and Sylvester in 1858.

an oscillator, and they make assumptions about the number of degrees of
freedom of the ether. ... This factor, however, can be derived only from
classical theory. This is the unsatisfactory feature in all derivations"</div>

	<div id="fnNotAssociative" style="display: none;">
		<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the dot product nor the inner product operator is associative
because the dot and inner product operations between a vector and a scalar is not defined.
Each operator is only valid between two vectors.
However there is a kind of associative definition involving a scalar as shown.
The equality is a combination of the multiply and dot product or inner product operators.
A vector's magnitude is scaled by multiplication with a scaler.
For this associative equality to hold either A or B can be scaled but not both.
The right side of the equality shown scales the B vector by a, but it also holds if the A vector is scaled.</div>
	</div>

	<div id="fnComplexConjugate" style="display: none;">
		<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner product has its origin in Hamilton's quest for multiplication of complex valued vectors.
The imaginary component of the complex valued vector presents a special case for this operation.
In the case of the dot product from which the inner product is derived, two real valued vectors are the terms of the operation and the result is a single number.
That number represents what magnitude of the first real valued vector exists in the same direction as the second vector.
Ideally the Inner Product binary operator should be commutative the same as the Dot Product, however the commutative property only holds for the complex conjugate of the commuted operation.</div>
