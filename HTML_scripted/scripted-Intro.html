scripted-Intro.html: ABOUT OLD TUG'S Offer.

scripted-Intro.html is the initial page content displayed in the detail section of the main page.  This and all other web 
content on this site was hand written by me, John Hunsberger, to demonstrate some simple but elegant techniques.  This 
content is open for anyone to copy.  If you have questions about any of this content feel free to ask me.  The ideas 
presented are not invention, they are my application.

Design Notes:
  1. The page contains a reference that uses target = "_blank" to have the linked site displayed in a
     different tab of the browser.
  2. The document created by this page lives inside the DETAIL iframe of the index.html generated
     document.  Although Chrome does not allow the content of the DETAIL iframe to reassign content to
     another iframe, it is permitted to reload the DETAIL iframe with a new document using the anchor <a>
     link.  This is done below to allow the user to quickly navigate to the brief summary documents.
  3. This page contains a modal dialog box popup.

			Thank you for your interest in Old Tug.  Well, an old engineer who wants to share some personal interests.<br>
            I currently do contract work so I also present an overview of my experience and qualifications.

	<p class="paragraph">
	Thank you for your interest in Old Tug Tech Stuff offered by John Hunsberger.  My intent is to share some of
	my interests with others using this site.  I created the site entirely from HTML and CSS and included an explanation
	on how this was done for anyone interested.  This information is accessed using the "Dev Info" index on the left
	side of the displayed page.
    </p>
    
    <p class="paragraph">
    The first (currently only) interest shared is related to quantum mechanics.  I have found that people in general 
    do not grasp the meaning of quantum.  My thought process on this topic was that a historical treatment 
    of its evolution would be the most interesting way to present it.  I hope you also find it interesting.
    </p>

	For potential contract interest, the capability offer is presented in detail
	in <a href="../HTML_unscripted/unscripted-Capability.html">Capabilities</a>.  
	This is a guide to understand the self assessment
	used to rank these capabilities.  With over thirty years of engineering experience the offer of
	services includes the following general areas. Refer to these individual links for more details.

<!-- This script must be included as the last thing the browser reads and executes.  I'm not sure why
     but I think it is because the variable definition is used for the functions and so the document
     model must be complete before the elements can be referenced to assign them functions.  'modalView'
     is assigned to the element with ID 'myModal' which is a <div> defined at the start of this document.
     The <div> is the modal dialog message that is displayed.
