scripted-Quantum Introduction.html: What is Quantum

scripted-Quantum Introduction.html is content displayed in the detail section of the main page that 
introduces quantum and links to articles about quantum particles.
This and all other web content on this site was hand written by me, John Hunsberger, to demonstrate some simple but 
elegant techniques.  This content is open for anyone to copy.  If you have questions about any of this content feel 
free to ask me.  The ideas presented are not invention, they are my application.

Quantum Mechanics is the study of the mechanics of particles that have quantum states.
The term Quantum may imply "very small" but "very small" is just an implied property.
Quantize means restricted in value.
That means that each quantum property does not have a continuous value but rather it's value is one of a set of fixed discrete values.
A quantum state is then a physical state that is expressed by a set of quantized properties.
</p><p class="paragraph">
The objects that are studied by quantum mechanics are subatomic particles.
Subatomic particles are small entities that clearly exhibit the discrete measurable physical properties called quantum states.
It is assumed that all matter has quantum states however as the size of the matter increases the quantum states become increasingly less detectable.

This site's article '<a href="./scripted-Quantum.html">Electron's Quantum Properties, A History</a>' reviews the historical evolution of the recent understanding of quantum states and mechanics.
The focus is on the subatomic particle "electron".
The intent is to introduce the quantum properties of the electron and outline the historical contributions that aided in the definition of these properties.
The quantum properties of the electron are represented by the letters <i>n</i> "shell number", <i>l</i> "azimuthal number", <i>m</i> "magnetic number" and <i>s</i> "spin number".

This site's article '<a href="./scripted-Quantum Statistics.html">Satyendra Nath Bose, Quantum Statistics</a>' examines Bose's introduction of Quantum Statistics.
It offers a detailed discussion of his famous 1924 paper <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1994JApA...15....3B/0000003.000.html ">"PLANCK'S LAW AND THE LIGHT QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS"</a> published in the American Journal of Physics.
Although the article is strongly mathematical there are side discussions included that hopefully dispel some of the rigor.
Bose's publication is significant to quantum theory because it introduced the idea that quantum states can be indistinguishable.
By defining that any number of particles may be in the same quantum state, he derived the blackbody radiation formula derived by Max Planck by using only statistics and without reliance on classical theory.
