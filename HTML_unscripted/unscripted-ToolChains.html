unscripted-AboutThisPage.html: ABOUT OLD TUG ENGINEERING skills.

unscripted-AboutThisPage.html is content displayed in the detail section of the main page that explains the motive
for creating this site and some insight to what was gained by doing it.  
This and all other web content on this site was hand written by me, John Hunsberger, to demonstrate some simple but 
elegant techniques.  This content is open for anyone to copy.  If you have questions about any of this content feel 
free to ask me.  The ideas presented are not invention, they are my application.

Design Notes:
