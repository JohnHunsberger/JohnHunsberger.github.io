unscripted-History.html: ABOUT OLD TUG work history.

unscripted-History.html is the overall work history page content displayed in the detail section of the main page.

Design Notes:
  1. The page contains a reference that uses target = "_blank" to have the linked site displayed in a
     different tab of the browser.
  2. There is currently a difference between how IE/FF and Chrome execute a table's width style statement.
     Evidently Chrome does not use the width statement correctly if it is declared in a subsequent <tr>.
     The fix was simple enough and is probably a best practice.  Use the <colgroup> tag.
