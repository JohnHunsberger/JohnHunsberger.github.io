<!--  
  unscripted-Master.html is the page content displayed in the master section of the main page.  This and all other web 
  content on this site was hand written by me, John Hunsberger, to demonstrate some simple but elegant techniques.  This 
  content is open for anyone to copy.  If you have questions about any of this content feel free to ask me.  The ideas 
  presented are not invention, they are my application.

  Design Notes:
  1. Here I have added HTML anchor links to other content pages.  The use of anchors is required in the absence of the
     javascript serviced events in order to enable links to other page content.
  2. This page is embedded into an iframe in 'unscripted-Intro.html'.  In order to have the href link serve to substitute
     that page and not the iframe content it is necessary to include the 'target="_parent" ' anchor property.
