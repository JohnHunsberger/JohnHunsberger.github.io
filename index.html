  index.html is the initial web page (index page) of a web site that serves to index other pages that either exist at
  the same site or at other reachable URLs.  This and all other web content on this site was hand written by 
  John Hunsberger to demonstrate some simple, perhaps useful techniques and to highlight some issues as well.  This 
  content is open for anyone to copy.  The ideas presented are not my invention, they are my application.
  
  The presentation design pattern used on index.html is the horizontal Master/Detail.  It's purpose is to 
  display a table structure in the Master division and user selected page information in the detail 
  section.
  
  Design Notes:
  [!]. Never insert comment block before the html declaration!!!  It results in browser formatting errors!
    1. There are two major divisions {scripted and noscript} defined in the <body> .  Only one or the other will 
       be visible depending on whether or not scripting is enabled for the user's browser. The scripted division is 
       divided into four subdivisions {header, master, detail, footer}.  Refer to MasterDetail.css for details on
       how these subdivisions are formatted in the page.
    2. Each division is assigned an id name that is used by the CSS style for reference.
    3. The <body> style for the main <div>'s is the included file "MasterDetail.css".
    4. Care has been taken to address clients with Javascript turned off.  When turned off
       the event threads cannot be processed, so a strictly static page is displayed.
       ScriptCheck.css and scriptcheck-js.eclipse.js provide the style and javascript to
       hide the script code in this document.  The <noscript> element is used to insert the 
       static page.
    5. The script based content of this page is manipulated using the Formatting.css style data
       and the formatting-js.eclipse.js methods.  The formatting is strictly presentation
       control.  This intentionally separates the presentation model from the content.
    5.a. To apply a style from a linked style sheet assign the style name to the object's class.  For example
       class="masterListMajor" where masterListMajor style is linked from 'Formatting.css'.
    6. Page maintenance must be simplified.  Comments have been added to explain special
       conditions.  Script and style information are contained in separate files that are included
       in the head of this page to structure and partition the overall content.  This allows
       common code to be collected and makes maintenance/reuse easier.
    7. A modal dialog box is displayed when scripted-Intro.html is displayed.  To prevent that from being
       displayed each time the user returns to that screen during the same session the 'justOnce' property
       was added to the window.sessionStorage (as opposed to using a cookie).  This is available in HTML5
       only so some user browsers will not be able to suppress continued display of the modal dialog.
       I chose sessionStorage over localStorage for the obvious reason.

  Design Notes:
    1. Each browser has a different default margin, border and padding setting for the <body> typically referred to as 
       a "User Agent Stylesheet".  To avoid variation in the display produced a Reset CSS is used for the <body>.
       Refer to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12582624/what-is-user-agent-stylesheet.

		The header division content is structured using a table structure for element placement.  
		
		Design Notes:
		1. It is intended that the header is presented in different configurations and with different
		   graphics to conform best to the width of the client's view.  This is accomplished using
		   the call to javascript method 'formatter()' in the script file formatting-js.eclipse.js.
		2. It is desired that the header icon image be left justified.  The "header" element is
		   assigned text-align:left; style in MasterDetail.css that forces it to be displayed
		   at the left of the page.

		The master division will load its content using the iframe with the source file HTML_scripted/scripted-master.html.  
		
		Design Notes:
		[!] In some browsers it was possible to use iframe to get the master content as a separate document.  Chrome has
		   a security policy that prevents that design approach from working.  In that browser it is not permitted for
		   included content to access elements on the including document.  So this main document, index.html, cannot
		   have the iframe src property of the detail content reassigned by an included master document.  To circumvent
		   that restriction the document created for the master frame was made part of this document.
		2. The master div's height is fixed and the included iframe's height is set to 100% of that. 
		3. The default font size varies among browsers.  The intent is to have a single line of text for each entry so
		   the font cannot be arbitrary.  Font is a text property so it must be set in the included document.

<!--  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Just an explanation about this partitioned content... the following was inserted from a file named scripted-Master.html.
  scripted-Master.html is the page content displayed in the master section of the main page.  This and all other web 
  content on this site was hand written by John Hunsberger to demonstrate some simple, perhaps useful techniques and 
  to highlight some issues as well.  This content is open for anyone to copy.  If you have questions or opinions about 
  this content feel free to contact me.  The ideas presented are not my invention, they are my application.

  Design Notes:
  [!] In some browsers it was possible to use iframe to get the master content as a separate document.  Chrome has
		a security policy that prevents that design approach from working.  In that browser it is not permitted for
		included content to access elements on the including document.  So this main document, index.html, cannot
		have the iframe src property of the detail content reassigned by an included master document.  To circumvent
  [!] Placing a table inside a table requires embedding the table using <tr><td><table>...  It must be
      a row's data entry.
  [!] Local references to script or style files must navigate the file folder structure correctly.  Be mindful of
      locality within the folder structure.
  1. Here I have added HTML events and javascript functions to add functionality to the displayed Master division.
  2. The event method definition uses the javascript "this" to pass in a reference to the document element issuing 
     the call.
  3. It is desired that the Master division on the main page be the same color as the division background.  There are some
     differences among browsers.  It is necessary to set the background-Color for both the body of this "included" page 
     and its div.
  4. It is desired that the lines in each row do not create a line break.  Because the default font size seems to
     vary among browsers the font-size style is specified.
  5. Special attention needs to be paid on exactly how the color is passed to the event's javascript function.  The text 
     of the event must be in single quotes to make it a color constant.
  6. The intent is to display a line between cells.  Some browsers may ignore this line unless there is an entry so
     the &nbsp special space character must be included.  To prevent the line cell being displayed too high, both
     the font-size and the line-height styles are included to assure that it is a narrow cell height.
  7. Because of inheritance you can specify background and foreground colors for a specific container element and the 
     background and foreground colors will automatically be inherited by any child elements in that container. So the
     table element background colors are inherited from the div that contains it.  Individual elements within a
     container can set their colors independently.  This is important for the mouse event procedure.

		The detail division will initially load content using the iframe with the source file HTML_cripted/scripted-Intro.html.  
		
		Design Notes:
		1. Use iframe to get the currently selected detail content.
		2. The iframe presentation requires special formatting to make the inserted page data appear like part of the 
		   index.html page.  This is an aspect of HTML5 that is poorly supported.  At present the "seamless" property
		   may well not be implemented in all browsers, but the older "frameborder=0" and "scrolling=0" are.  Although 
		   frameborder and scrolling are no longer considered supported by the HTML5 spec it is still supported by most 
		   browsers.
		3. To get the iframe size to fit into the div space correctly the containing div must be assigned 
		   a fixed width value.  The iframe is assigned width:100% so the div width determines the iframe width.  The div 
		   is assigned a computed fixed width by the resizeDetail() method in the scripts/formatting-js.eclipse.js file.
		4. The div's height is also fixed and again, the iframe's height is set to 100% of that.
		5. The actual html displayed in the iframe for 'detail' is determined by the -master.html file.  The scripted/
		   scripted-Master.html file uses the master-js.eclipse.js file's onclick() event to execute a script mouseClick().  
		   That script method will reassign the src property of the iframe according to the items clicked by the user.

            The following paragraph id="displayDebugInfo" can be used to display debugging information.  If used, increase
            the reserved space at the bottom of the page in formatting-js.eclipse.js resizeMasterDetailHeight() method's
            v_4 variable to height of displayDebugInfo.
            
            Removing the 'displayDebugInfo' paragraph impacts the vertical height of the <body>.  When the height is less than
            the required display a scroll bar is shown at the right of the <body>.  The scroll bar consumes about 20px of
            horizontal space.  When the scroll bar is absent the header and footer width uses the space that the scroll bar would
            take.  The master width is fixed width but the detail width is recomputed so that it fills the available space, which
            includes the width of the absent scroll bar.  If the displayDebugInfo paragraph is added then the height required will
            exceed the computed height and a scroll bar will be displayed.  The browser will automatically adjust the header and
            footer to accommodate that but the computed width for the detail will be too much by a scroll bar and will not float
            next to the master.  This is why it is important to add in the width of the displayDebugInfo paragraph in v_4 of the
            resizeMasterDetailHeight() method if it is used.
